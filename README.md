# HangmanGame
This is my version of Hangman! Makes use of many Python skills. Check out the README file for more info!


This is my version of Hangman! You can choose how long your word is, and it will give you a word from a text file of 10,000 words! You have six lives, and this game will keep track of your correct, and incorrect guesses. Makes use of Python classes, and strings. Also reads from a text file, and takes user inputs.
